===========================

Source code to support getting started using Selenium WebDriver with Java

The source code has only really been uploaded in case people encounter problems following the instructions or make a very simple mistake that they cannot figure out.

Please read the comments below, and the source code comments if you are having trouble starting work with Firefox.


## Steps

* First install Java, Maven and IntelliJ
    * [Java Install Checklist](https://github.com/eviltester/startUsingJavaJUnit/blob/master/speedrun_install_java_checklist.md)
* Second install Firefox, GeckoDriver, Chrome and ChromeDriver
    * [WebDriver Install Checklist](https://github.com/eviltester/startUsingSeleniumWebDriver/blob/master/speedrun_install_checklist.md)


If you are using Chrome and have added ChromeDriver to the path then use the command line:

`mvn test -Dtest=MyFirstChromeTest`

**For Firefox see the notes below for the version of Selenium WebDriver you are using.**

Do not run `mvn test` because some of the tests are WebDriver version dependant and at least one will fail.

## Notes for Selenium WebDriver 3.0.1

### Running with Firefox

If you are using Firefox 45 Extended Release version (or Firefox < v48) then to run the test from the command line use:

`mvn test -Dtest=MyFirstLegacyFFTest`

If you are using Firefox 48+ and have added Marionette `geckodriver.exe` to the path then use the command line:

`mvn test -Dtest=MyFirstTest`

The following will also work with Firefox 48+, but will fail in a future version of WebDriver because the `MarionetteDriver` is deprecated.

`mvn test -Dtest=MyFirstTestFF48`

### Running with Chrome

If you are using Chrome and have added ChromeDriver to the path then use the command line:

`mvn test -Dtest=MyFirstChromeTest`

## Notes for Selenium WebDriver 2.53.1

### Running with Firefox

If you are using Firefox 45 Extended Release version (or Firefox < v48) then to run the test from the command line use:

`mvn test -Dtest=MyFirstTest`

If you are using Firefox 48+ and have added Marionette `geckodriver.exe` to the path (renamed to `wires.exe`) then use the command line:

`mvn test -Dtest=MyFirstTestFF48`

### Running with Chrome

If you are using Chrome and have added ChromeDriver to the path then use the command line:

`mvn test -Dtest=MyFirstChromeTest`

## Update 19th October 2016

Updated the Notes to cover Firefox on WebDriver 2.53.1 and 3.0.1.

## Update 4th October 2016

* Added the Mac Instructions, and moved Java install to the [Java checklist and project](https://github.com/eviltester/startUsingJavaJUnit/blob/master/speedrun_install_java_checklist.md)

## Update 30th September 2016

I have added a test for ChromeDriver into the code:

* `MyFirstChromeTest`

This has comments explaining where to locate the chromedriver.exe or just add the folder with chromedriver.exe to the path.

## Update 27th September 2016

I have added two tests into the code:

* `MyFirstTest`
* `MyFirstTestFF48`

`MyFirstTest` has all the comments explaining all the multiple uses of Firefox and defaults to using the FirefoxDriver - in selenium 2 this will only work with Firefox 47 or below. With Selenium 3 you could run this if Marionette driver is on the path.

`MyFirstTestFF48` is a cut down test that uses the MarionetteDriver and assumes that wires.exe is on the path.

## Update 7th July 2016

Firefox 47 was incompatible with Selenium 2.53.0 so we needed to use marionette driver.

Firefox 47.1 is compatible with Selenium 2.53.1 allowing us to use the `FirefoxDriver` again.

The blog post below describes how to use a local version of Selenium with maven if any incompatibility happens again and you need to move to a different version of WebDriver which is not on maven central.

## Update 22nd June 2016

Added information about using portable firefox driver and more comments.

## Update 25th April 2016

Firefox 46 changes the way that WebDriver has to interact with it. So the built in `FirefoxDriver` did not work. You need to install Firefox 45 from [Firefox Extended Support Release](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/organizations/all/) to continue using `FirefoxDriver`.

If you want to use Firefox 46 and later then you may need to use the [Marionette](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/QA/Marionette/WebDriver) driver.

Follow the instructions on the Marionette page to download it. You do not need to add it to your path, you can control that through a system property - see the code in this project for more detail.

You can also use portable Firefox as described in this blog post

* http://seleniumsimplified.com/2016/06/using-portable-firefox-46-with-webdriver/

All of this is explained in the source code, or in the blog posts:

* http://seleniumsimplified.com/2016/06/using-portable-firefox-46-with-webdriver/


## Pre April 2016 updates

The code has changed slightly because we now need to do a .close and a .quit to exit Firefox

And I've updated the version of WebDriver.
