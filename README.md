Easy testing automation solution in Java, Maven, Cucumber and Selenium WebDriver and more
===========================

This simple project demonstrates Web UI test automation solution written in **Java**, **Maven**, **Cucumber** and **Selenium WebDriver** including cross browser testing support. We leverage powerful open-source libraries and tools to build automation testing framework which is easy to setup and maintain even for newbies in Java world.

We use [WebDriverManager](https://github.com/bonigarcia/webdrivermanager) which currently supports management of **Chrome**, **Opera**, **Internet Explorer**,**Microsoft Edge**, **PhantomJS**, and **Firefox**.

In addition to that there is API testing support:
* **REST API** testing example with leverage of [Rest Assured](https://github.com/rest-assured/rest-assured), [WireMock](https://github.com/tomakehurst/wiremock) for mocking service responses, and [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) for convenient work with POJO's 
*  **JMS API** testing example using [Apache ActiveMQ](http://activemq.apache.org/) embedded broker for mocking server-side

In future we also plan to show here how to auto test **JMX**, **RMI**, **JDBC** and more. Other than that, there is plan to show how to do data-driven testing in Cucumber and how to run unit tests, integration tests and executable specifications from a single call to Junit.

Furthermore, we plan to show how to do flexible and beautiful test reporting using [Allure](https://github.com/allure-framework/) and integrate your test base to CI tools
