Easy testing automation solution in Java, Maven, Cucumber and Selenium WebDriver and more
===========================

This simple project demonstrates Web UI test automation solution written in **Java**, **Maven**, **Cucumber** and **Selenium WebDriver** including cross browser testing support. We leverage powerful open-source libraries and tools to build automation testing framework which is easy to setup and maintain even for newbies in Java world.

We use [WebDriverManager](https://github.com/bonigarcia/webdrivermanager) which currently supports management of **Chrome**, **Opera**, **Internet Explorer**,**Microsoft Edge**, **PhantomJS**, and **Firefox**.

In addition to that there is **REST API** testing support with future aim to leverage [Rest Assured](https://github.com/rest-assured/rest-assured) in near future

In future we also plan to show here how to auto test **JMS**, **JMX**, **RMI**, **JDBC** and more. For example, [WireMock](https://github.com/tomakehurst/wiremock) for mocking HTTP-based APIs or [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) for data-driven test approach.

Furthermore, we plan to show how to do flexible and beautiful test reporting using [Allure](https://github.com/allure-framework/) and integrate your test base to CI tools
